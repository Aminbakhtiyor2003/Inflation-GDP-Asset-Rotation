InflationGDPAssetRotation: My First Step Toward Systematic Regime Investing

This algorithm was one of my earliest attempts at translating a high-level macroeconomic thesis into a rules-based portfolio rotation strategy. The design was simple: use observed trends in inflation and GDP growth to infer the economic regime and dynamically tilt capital between growth-oriented equities, defensive assets, energy, real estate, and cash. My thinking was to create a mechanical process that would avoid emotional decision-making while still adapting exposure to changing macro conditions. It was an exercise in learning how to turn intuition into code and test how well the story I believed in held up historically.

The model classified environments using just two macro variables. When inflation rose while growth weakened, it favored defensives. When both inflation and growth rose, it rotated into energy and growth equities. When both fell, it moved partially or fully to cash. The decision to rely heavily on cash came from research I had read showing that missing the five worst days in the stock market dramatically improves long-term returns. I wanted to build a crude mechanism that stepped aside during turbulent periods, preserving capital until conditions stabilized. This gave the model a circuit-breaker quality: if growth data turned down or both signals weakened, it would liquidate into cash equivalents.

The structure worked in backtests, but its flaws became obvious with more scrutiny. Economic data is lagging, noisy, and subject to revision. By the time CPI or GDP confirmed a trend, markets had often already adjusted, leaving my algorithm reacting late. The monthly rebalance schedule added to this latency, meaning it often rotated after the move had happened. The allocations themselves were arbitrary, based on simple heuristics rather than a probabilistic assessment of expected returns. The reliance on cash for protection helped in drawdowns but lacked nuance and could also miss rebounds by being overly defensive. Risk management beyond this was minimal with no volatility-based sizing rules or adaptive stop-losses to limit mistakes.

If I were to rebuild this strategy today, I would not rely solely on static macro prints. Instead, I would combine market-implied information such as asset price momentum, volatility term structures, and cross-asset spreads with macro data to anticipate rather than react to regime shifts. I would replace deterministic weights with probability-adjusted allocations, inspired by Kelly Criterion sizing, allowing capital to flow toward the highest-expected-value ideas dynamically. Stop-losses would be tighter, adaptive, and volatility-scaled, cutting risk long before a 10–15% drawdown developed. And rather than blunt monthly rebalancing, I would introduce event-driven triggers, moving the portfolio only when signals meaningfully changed.

This algorithm was a starting point and a first attempt at systematic macro investing. It taught me how quickly elegant theories can fail under the friction of reality, and how critical it is to think about timing, probability, and market-implied information rather than purely economic fundamentals. It laid the groundwork for the more nuanced regime models I build today, where the goal is no longer to react to yesterday’s economy, but to listen to the market’s forward-looking signals and adapt before the crowd.
